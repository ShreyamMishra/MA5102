% 3. Header (and Footer)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% To make our document nice we want a header and number the pages in the footer.

\pagestyle{fancy} 
\fancyhf{}

\lhead{Assignment}% \lhead puts text in the top left corner. \footnotesize sets our font to a smaller size.

%\rhead works just like \lhead (you can also use \chead)
\rhead{Shreyam Mishra, 19D110020} %<---- Fill in your details.
% Similar commands work for the footer (\lfoot, \cfoot and \rfoot).
% We want to put our page number in the center.
\rfoot{Page \thepage \hspace{1pt} of \pageref{LastPage}}
\cfoot{\footnotesize \thepage} 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 4. Your document
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Now, you need to tell LaTeX where your document starts. We do this with the \begin{document} command.
% Like brackets every \begin{} command needs a corresponding \end{} command. We come back to this later.

\begin{document}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Title section of the document
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% For the title section we want to reproduce the title section of the Problem Set and add your names.

\thispagestyle{empty} % This command disables the header on the first page. 


\begin{center} % Everything within the center environment is centered.
	{\Large \bf MA 5102 - Algebraic Topology}
	\vspace{2mm} % to add some vertical space in between the lines
	
	\bf{Assignment} % <---- Don't forget to put in the right number
	
	\vspace{2mm}
	
        % YOUR NAMES GO HERE
	{\bf Shreyam Mishra, 19D110020} % <---- Fill in your name and ID number here.
		
\end{center}  

\vspace*{0.3cm} 

\begin{center}
    \textbf{\large{Topological Properties of the Orthogonal Group}}
\end{center}

% Up until this point you only have to make minor changes for every assignment (Number of the assignment). Your write up essentially starts here.

%\textbf{Question 2:} \emph{Prove an analogue of Theorem 1.8 for $n$ functions}. \\
%\textbf{Solution:} LSwT
%
%Analogue of Theorem 1.8 is stated as follows: 
%\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced,attach boxed title to top center={yshift=-3mm,yshifttext=-1mm},
%  colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,colbacktitle=red!80!black,
%  title=Theorem 1.8's Analogue,fonttitle=\bfseries,
%  boxed title style={size=small,colframe=red!50!black} ]
%Let $u_1, u_2, \hdots , u_n$  be real measurable functions on a measurable space $X$, let $f$ be a continuous mapping of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ into a topological space $Y$, and define:
%\begin{equation*}
%    h(x) = f(u_1(x), u_2(x), \hdots , u_n(x))
%\end{equation*}
%for $x \in X$. Then $h: X \rightarrow Y$ is measurable.
